          <h1>Requirements</h1>
          <p>Every fall parents and students ask the Graphic Design faculty for advice on what type of equipment to purchase for use in our program. Below is our recommendation.</p>
          <p>Equipment and software in our program is based entirely on the Apple Macintosh platform, we recommend Apple products for our students</p>
          <p>What screen size is the best? Do I need more storage space? Do I need an additional hard drive? Depending on your financial ability the answers to these questions will depend. If you have any questions please contact <a
              href="https://drexel.edu/westphal/about/directory/ReesBill/" target="_blank">Bill Rees</a>, program director.</p>
          <article class="call-out">
            <p>The best thing to do is visit an Apple store and test the equipment there before making your decision.</p>
